      <h3>Bio:</h3>

      <p class = "green">I am an incoming high school junior who enjoys spending time with friends and family. When I am not out with my friends or family, I am either reading (articles, fiction, memoirs), writing fanfiction, or watching YouTube blogs by career experts. I also enjoy exploring the tech industry and all it encompasses.</p>

    <em><strong>Chatbot:</strong></em> Using Python and the Command Line, I made an interactive chatbot that replies to input from the user. The chatbot is able to have a conversation, play hangman, tell a 3-5-3 haiku, and perform basic math equations. In order to create this program, I learned how to efficiently use functions, variables, loops, conditionals, and comments.
